# BLR

This is a remake of the http://biolitrepo.org. While it looks almost the same as the original, it has been  completely rewritten in plain html and JavaScript. Unlike the old version, this requires no `sass`, no `react`, no `babel`, no `webpack`, no `nodejs` to compile and prepare the files, and at 170KB, it is almost two orders of magnitude less in size (< 60 KB vs > 4.5 MB). It can be hosted on any webserver without any modifications and it will just work. In fact, it is [running right here on Github Pages â€” check it out](https://punkish.github.io/blr/).
