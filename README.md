# BLR

This is a remake of the http://biolitrepo.org. While it looks almost the same as the original, it has been  completely rewritten in plain html and JavaScript. Unlike the old version, this requires no `sass`, no `react`, no `babel`, or complicated `webpack` configuration. `nodejs` and `gulpjs` are used to compile and prepare the files and copy them to the `/docs` folder from where Github serves the website. And at 170KB, the website is almost two orders of magnitude less in size than the previous version (< 60 KB vs > 4.5 MB). It can be hosted on any webserver without any modifications and it will just work. In fact, it is [running right here on Github Pages â€” check it out](https://plazi.github.io/blr/).

Oh, and this also runs against [Zenodeo v3](https://test.zenodeo.org/) as opposed to the old version that uses Zenodeo V2.
